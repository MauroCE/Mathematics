# Mathematics
This repository contains various code regarding
different branches of Mathematics. I use this as a container 
for classes and functions that might be useful in other
projects that I'm working on. I hope some of the scripts here
will be useful to someone on the internet.


It also contains some of the Python code that I developed to solve exercises for modules like [MATH3018 Numerical Methods](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/modules/math3018.page) and [MATH3016 Optimization](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/modules/math3016.page) at the University of Southampton. This code includes courseworks and tutorial sheets.
